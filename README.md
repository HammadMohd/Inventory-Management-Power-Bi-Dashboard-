# Inventory-Management-Power-Bi-Dashboard-

This project provides an Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI to help Warehouse and In-plant Inventory Managers effectively manage inventory levels and maintain service levels. The dashboard provides key insights into stock status, reorder levels, inventory turnover, demand forecasting, and more.


# Tools Used:
Power BI : For data visualization, analysis, and dashboard creation.

Excel : For data storage, pre-processing, and integration with Power BI.

# Key Components of the Inventory Analysis Dashboard:
ABC Classification : Categorizes inventory based on importance, typically by value and volume, to prioritize management focus on critical items.

XYZ Classification: Analyzes demand variability, grouping items into categories with high, medium, and low demand predictability.

Inventory Turnover Ratio : Measures the rate at which inventory is used up and restocked, reflecting efficiency in inventory usage.

Safety Stock Levels :  Calculates optimal safety stock to mitigate the risk of stockouts.

Estimation of Reorder Levels and Safety stock : Determines reorder points to help plan stock replenishments.

Calculation of Average weekly demands : Tracks demand trends to aid in more accurate forecasting.

Stock Status : Provides real-time insights into current stock levels and potential shortages.

Forecasting for the next time period :Projects future demand based on historical trends.

# Visualization Used:

- Stack Area Chart: Depicts cumulative metrics (e.g., cumulative value or quantity) for different categories (ABC).

- Cards, Gauges, and Slicers: Display key metrics (e.g., inventory levels by area, safety stock requirements).

- Tables and Matrices: Provide detailed data views on stock distribution, turnover ratio, and reports.

- Line Charts: Show trends over time, like changes in inventory levels or turnover rates.

- DAX Functions: Used extensively for calculations, aggregations, and custom columns. Calculated Columns and Rows in DAX help combine or manipulate data (e.g., creating time-based segments for analysis).


# Steps followed for Creating Inventory Management Dashboard:

Data Import:

Upload Excel files or connect to data sources using Power BIâ€™s Get Data feature.

ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):

Clean, shape, and transform data in Power Query Editor.
Normalize data to ensure accuracy in analysis (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing values).

Data Modeling:

Establish relationships between tables, set primary keys, and organize data for analysis.
Use calculated columns and measures in DAX for complex calculations.

DAX Operations:

Create measures for KPIs like average demand, reorder points, and turnover ratios.
DAX expressions are used for custom calculations and time intelligence functions (e.g., cumulative totals).

Visualization Setup:

Select appropriate charts, cards, and tables to visualize data insights.
Use slicers to enable filtering by categories (e.g., product type, region).
Format visualizations for clarity and ease of interpretation.

Dashboard Finalization:

Arrange visuals to create an intuitive, user-friendly layout.
Customize colors, labels, and tooltips for better readability.

# Conclusion:

This Inventory Management Dashboard empowers inventory managers to control stock effectively, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts. By setting optimal reorder points and monitoring real-time stock status, it enables proactive decision-making and supports better service level maintenance.
